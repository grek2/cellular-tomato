<h3>Sporesdale Bioraiders: An alternate universe.</h3>Instead of robots made of gears and wires, we have... weird fungal plants or something. The growbotics competition is soon, but due to a lack of funding,
your team only has one type of growth to work with. Now you must figure out the most optimal placement of the simple spores you have in order to win the most points.
