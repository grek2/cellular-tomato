<h3>Sporesdale Bioraiders: An alternate universe.</h3>Instead of robots made of gears and wires, we have... weird fungal plants or something. The growbotics competition is soon, but due to a lack of funding,
your team only has one type of growth to work with. Now you must figure out the most optimal placement of the simple spores you have in order to win the most points.
<h3></h3>
If we had more time to work on this, I would have added easier and harder levels with the same basic layout, but change the small details that interact with the growbot in certain ways, like the placement of the green pixels outside the starting area, or whether some penalty zones are walls or not.
